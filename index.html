                    <h4>MySQL Database Engineering & Cost Optimization</h4>
                    <p>Ensured high reliability and availability of MySQL databases (65000+ baremetal servers at one point); led database engineering initiatives. Drove cost-saving measures by merging low-traffic read replica pools, saving over 200 bare-metal servers. Created a rule-based model using queries running, peak time, CPU/memory usage to predict which pools can be merged. Involved stakeholders in the loop with heightened application level latency and throughput alerting.</p>
                    <ul class="project-features">
                        <li>Tooling for safe splitting (with zero downtime) of MySQL database chains when database size reaches more than a percentage of disk space.</li>
                        <li>Added self-healing to ensure reliability which includes but not limited to:
                            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                <li>Identifying and removing stale distributed locks. Before the self healing, such stale locks prevented successful cloning of new replicas and master switchovers / failovers.</li>
                                <li>Identifying and fixing broken replication</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>DistributedCaching of alerts on database servers to reduce load on alerting APIs.</li>
                        <li>Usage of network maintenance APIs to do pre-emptive automatedswitchovers of database primaries during the period of low traffic.</li>
                        <li>MySQL Clusters DNS Migration from a deprecated platform to a new one.</li>
                        <li>Cost saving measures during covid to reduce MySQL Database Servers. One initiative I took was to merge pools of read replicas with low traffic (identified using query load, number of connections, query latency, peak timings, etc.). This measure resulted in saving over 200 servers saving millions for the company.</li>
                        <li>Fast external service to monitor read/write availability of MySQL databases. It can ping thousands of servers every second and gave a better view of availability and latency metrics to MySQL clients. The service was written in Go and extensively used Go concurrency patterns. These availability and latency metrics were directly used by MySQL Service's SLO dashboards.</li>
                        <li>Tools for publishing critical alerts like disk space usage directly to MySQL clients so that they can take pre-emptive action. Additionally, I kept the corresponding opdocs up-to-date for correct handling of such alerts.</li>

                    <h4>Audio Genre Classification</h4>
                    <p>Developed and implemented an algorithm for classification of correct song through an input sound clip or tune. High-noise input was also considered in the project.</p>
